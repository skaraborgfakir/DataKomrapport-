abstract = {During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Swedish kings demanded ever increasing taxes and military conscription from their subjects, arguing that they received protection in return. Both types of levy, however, were used for offensive warfare, and when there seemed to be a real threat of invasion during the wars of Charles X Gustav in 1655–1660, his subjects were asked to contribute more, or even to manage their own defences. Since the Diet had not agreed to these new demands, they were open to discussion, and what then followed can be understood as a negotiation of the definitions of the military and civilian spheres. With empirical examples from the counties of Dalarna and Uppland, this article investigates the extraordinary charges placed on Swedish subjects in times of war in addition to the well-known ordinary taxes and conscription, and how the powers that be justified it. How did the peasants respond, and what arguments or other strategies did they use? What happened when the agreement between ruler and subjects was broken, when an invasion was pending, or when the demands went beyond taxation or conscription? Should the critical situation that arose be interpreted as a royal failure? Can these negotiations help us trace the divide between what were considered the responsibilities of ruler and subject in times of war?},

@article{JanssonKarinHassan2006Violence,

abstract = {Violence as Aggression or Communication? Breaches of ‘Home peace’ 1550–1650 Based on a study of around a hundred breaches of ‘home peace’ in Sweden between 1550 and 1650, this article investigates the cultural meaning of acts of violence and the relationship between masculinities and violence in early modern society. A central theoretical assumption is that violence has a cultural meaning. Furthermore, in legal proceedings, violant acts was loaded with meaning by the parties, witnesses and judges.  In Court records certain symbolically charged elements tend to appear frequently. A central element is that the aggressor appeared at the home of the defendant in arms, knocked loudly on the door and insulted the defendant. The aggressor thereby signalled the existence of a conflict and challenged the defendant to fight it out. According to the records, the defendants typically declined the challenge and tried to stop the attack. Many defendants hid themselves, others sent out their wives to meet the aggressor or attempted to calm him down. Violence exercised in conjunction with breaches of ‘home peace’cannot be said to be signs of a failure to exercise self-restraint. Rather, such violence was charged with symbolic meaning, which was interpreted against the backdrop of a number of written and unwritten norms. Court records describe the aggressor as a rash and uncontrolled man—the opposite of the ideal man. His actions were characterised by fits of rage and unwarranted hostility. In contrast, the defender was described according to a positive stereotype. An important part of this stereotype was the refusal of the defendant to accept the challenge to fight and his attempts to avoid bloodshed. Previous research has argued that the male ideal of the sixteenth- and seventeenth centuries demanded that men defended their honour with violent means if necessary. This study demonstrates the existence of a more complex set of norms surrounding violence and manliness. It also shows that self-restraint was an important element of male ideals already in the early modern period, even in violent conflicts. Failure to appreciate this aspects of the male ideal are due to the failure of present day observers to appreciate the nuances and the shifting meanings of acts of violence in early modern society.},

abstract = {This article investigates popular perceptions of Swedishness in early 17th century Sweden. The starting point is the well-known fact that ordinary people used concepts such as Swedes and Danes to describe themselves and others. The empirical basis of the survey is popular narratives recorded in protocols from six Swedish county courts bordering the kingdom of Denmark during the period 1600-1658. The overall question is whether these expressions reflected a political or imagined cultural (ethnic) community. The result of the survey shows that, besides being perceived politically and judicially, on an everyday popular level Swedishness was also imagined as a cultural community. The ethnic dimension of this was not religious, and probably not linguistic, but consisted of an imagined community of being native-born and having kin and friends in a common emotionally associated fatherland.},
